# Apply the following three algorithms to train weights on a Neural Network from assignment 1.
# Randomized Hill Climbing
# Simulated Annealing
# Genetic algorithm
# MIMIC

# From assignment 1, I used Grid searches to find the best parameters. For the sake of consistency, I will use the
# exact same neural network in this assignment so I can directly compare the performance of the various algorithms to
# back propagation.

# Optimization Example Problems

# One Max

# Flip Flop

# Four Peaks Problem (Simulated Annealing example)

# K-Color Problem (MIMIC example)

# Flip Flop with adjusted fitness function
