# RandomizedOptimization
Project code for the machine learning course at Georgia Tech University.

Running the code to repeat the analysis I did is fairly simple. I used an anaconda interpreter set to python 3.6. All of the packages loaded are specified in the requirements.txt file. You can create the exact anaconda interpreter I used by loading the pacakges found in the requirements file. The core pacakges I installed where matplotlib v3.0.2, numpy v1.15.4, pandas v0.24.0, scikit-learn v0.20.2, and mlrose v1.0.1. Note that
I ended up using a direct download of mlrose from the github page as there were updates that had not yet been uploaded to the pip installer.

All of the source code is in the main.py file. 

The dataset is included in the repository and are in the root of the project so the code can read directly from them using a relative path. You don't need to change anything in the csv files for the code to work.
